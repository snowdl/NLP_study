# Function Calling Experiments

This folder contains experiments on function calling and self-improvement strategies for LLMs.

## Files
- **exp00_fc_self_improve_min.ipynb** — Minimal rules-based intent router with self-improvement.  
- **exp01_fc_self_improve_min.ipynb** — Extended version with more intents and evaluation.  
- **functionCalling_SelfImprovement.ipynb** — Prototype for self-improving function calling.  
- **FunctionCalling_Banking.ipynb** — Banking domain examples for function calling.  

## Purpose
These experiments demonstrate how LLMs can use function calling not only for API interaction,
but also to iteratively improve their own rule sets and intent detection performance.
