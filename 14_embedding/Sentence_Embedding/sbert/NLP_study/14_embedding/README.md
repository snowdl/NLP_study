📚 About Each Folder
Word Embedding
Contains classic word-level embedding techniques and implementations, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. Also includes subword methods to capture morphological information.

Sentence Embedding
Includes methods for generating embeddings at the sentence or document level. This includes models like Doc2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Sentence-BERT, as well as traditional methods like TF-IDF and LSA.

Transformer-Based Embedding
Focuses on embedding techniques based on Transformer architectures, such as BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, and OpenAI's API embeddings.

🚀 Usage
Explore each folder to find notebooks, scripts, and projects demonstrating various embedding techniques.
