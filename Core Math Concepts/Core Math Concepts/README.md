# Core Math Concepts

This folder contains my study notes on fundamental mathematical concepts essential for understanding machine learning and natural language processing.  
Included topics are logarithms, derivatives, limits, epsilon-delta definitions, and logistic regression cost functions.  

These notes serve as a foundation for my graduate studies and practical applications in NLP.
