## 🚀 movieRecommendation_llm_generator_20250629.ipynb

This notebook implements a movie recommendation system using the **GPT‑2** model along with **Semantic Search**.

### 🧠 Key Features
- **Model**: GPT‑2 (via Hugging Face Transformers), a lightweight LLM suitable for rapid prototyping
- **Search**: Semantic search to retrieve relevant movie descriptions based on keyword similarity
- **Input**: User preferences (genre, tone, style, etc.)  
- **Output**: 3–5 personalized movie recommendations generated by GPT‑2

### 🛠️ Components
- `semantic_search.py` – Handles embedding generation and similarity-based retrieval
- `prompt_template` – Includes few-shot examples for structured prompting
- GPT‑2 inference code – Tokenizes input → generates text → extracts recommendation list

### 💡 Example Use
```text
User: I like emotional sci-fi movies, something like Interstellar.
GPT‑2: If you enjoyed *Interstellar*, you might also like *Arrival*, *Her*, *Ad Astra*, and *The Fountain*.
