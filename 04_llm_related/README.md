# 🎬 LLM Related Projects

This folder contains various projects that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).  
Currently, it includes the following work, with more experiments and examples to be added in the future.

## 🚀 movieRecommendation_llm_generator_20250629.ipynb

This notebook implements a movie recommendation system using the **GPT‑2** model along with **Semantic Search**.

### 🧠 Key Features
- **Model**: GPT‑2 (via Hugging Face Transformers), a lightweight LLM suitable for rapid prototyping
- **Search**: Semantic search to retrieve relevant movie descriptions based on keyword similarity
- **Input**: User preferences (genre, tone, style, etc.)  
- **Output**: 3–5 personalized movie recommendations generated by GPT‑2

### 🛠️ Components
- `semantic_search.py` – Handles embedding generation and similarity-based retrieval
- `prompt_template` – Includes few-shot examples for structured prompting
- GPT‑2 inference code – Tokenizes input → generates text → extracts recommendation list

### 💡 Example Use
```text
