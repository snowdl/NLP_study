# ReAct Experiments

This folder contains experiments on **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**, a framework where LLMs combine reasoning traces (Thoughts) with actions (tool/API calls).

## Files
- **exp00_ReAct_vs_Non_ReAct_on_Iris.ipynb**  
  - Demo comparing standard classification vs. ReAct-style reasoning + acting on the Iris dataset.  
  - Shows how intermediate "Thought → Action → Observation → Answer" steps improve interpretability.  

## Purpose
ReAct experiments here will be extended to:
- Question answering with reasoning traces.
- Tool usage with API calls.
- Comparisons between ReAct and baseline methods.

Future notebooks will follow the naming convention:  
`exp01_*.ipynb`, `exp02_*.ipynb`, etc.
