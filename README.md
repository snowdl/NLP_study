# spaCy Essentials & Pipeline Customization

This repository contains practice code covering essential spaCy features including:

- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Phrase Matching with PhraseMatcher
- Custom pipeline components for sentence boundary detection and text splitting

The examples demonstrate how to analyze text tokens, count POS tags and dependencies, create and add custom entities, and extend the spaCy pipeline with user-defined components.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code for your own NLP projects!
