# ðŸ§  NLP_study

Welcome! This repository is a comprehensive personal study notebook documenting my journey through various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **LLM-related** online courses and projects.

The materials come from online lectures (Coursera, Udemy, K-MOOC, etc.) and include hands-on coding practices, math fundamentals, mini projects, and even certificate logs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Purpose

- To systematically **organize concepts and code** from NLP/LLM courses
- To practice **key techniques** from scratch using Python
- To build a **clean, traceable portfolio** for graduate program applications in NLP/AI
- To serve as a long-term **learning and revision hub**
