 NLP_study
Welcome! This repository is a comprehensive personal study notebook documenting my journey through various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLM-related online courses and projects.

The materials come from online lectures (Coursera, Udemy, K-MOOC, etc.) and include hands-on coding, math fundamentals, mini projects, and certificate logs.

 Purpose
Systematically organize concepts and code from NLP/LLM courses

Practice key techniques from scratch using Python

Build a clean, traceable portfolio for NLP/AI graduate program applications

Serve as a long-term learning and revision hub

 Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/snowdl/NLP_study.git
cd NLP_study
Install dependencies:
(Recommended: use a virtual environment)

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data location:

All datasets and data files are located in the 12_data folder.

All code and notebooks use relative paths (e.g., ./12_data/filename).

Please run all code from the project root directory (NLP_study).
