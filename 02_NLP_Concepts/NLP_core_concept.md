# NLP Core Concepts

## 1. Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)
- The process of automatically assigning parts of speech to each word in a sentence  
- Examples: Noun (NN), Verb (VB), Adjective (JJ), etc.  
- One of the fundamental preprocessing steps in NLP, used for syntactic parsing and semantic understanding  

## 2. Tokenization
- The process of splitting text into words, morphemes, or subword units  
- Morphological tokenization is important especially for languages like Korean  
- Tokenized output is used as input for models  

## 3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Automatically identifying important entities such as people, locations, dates in text  
- Used in information extraction, question answering systems, etc.  

## 4. Language Models
- Models essential for generating words and sentences, and understanding meaning  
- Popular models: GPT, BERT, Transformer-based models  
- Involves pre-training and fine-tuning stages  

## 5. Text Preprocessing
- Tasks like stopword removal, lowercasing, normalization, stemming, etc.  
- Aims to improve data quality and model performance
