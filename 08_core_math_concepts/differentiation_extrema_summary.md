# ðŸ““ Differentiation & Extrema Summary

## 1. Basic Differentiation Formula  
\[
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}
\]

- Applies to positive, negative, and fractional exponents.

---

## 2. Differentiation with Negative Exponents  
\[
\frac{d}{dx} x^{-n} = -n x^{-n-1}
\]

Example:  
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{d}{dx} x^{-2} = -2 x^{-3}
\]

---

## 3. Differentiation Example  
Function:  
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 - 5x^2 + 7x - 4
\]

Derivative:  
\[
f'(x) = 12x^3 - 10x + 7
\]

---

## 4. Second Derivative (Double Differentiation)  
\[
f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx} f'(x)
\]

- Used to determine extrema (maxima and minima).

---

## 5. How to Find Extrema

1. Find the first derivative \( f'(x) \).  
2. Solve \( f'(x) = 0 \) to find candidate points for extrema.  
3. Substitute candidates into the second derivative \( f''(x) \):

- If \( f''(x) > 0 \), the point is a local minimum.  
- If \( f''(x) < 0 \), the point is a local maximum.

---

## 6. Extrema Example

Function:  
\[
f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2
\]

- First derivative:  
\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x
\]

- Find critical points by solving:  
\[
3x^2 - 6x = 0 \implies x=0, x=2
\]

- Second derivative:  
\[
f''(x) = 6x - 6
\]

- Test candidates:  
\[
f''(0) = -6 < 0 \Rightarrow \text{local maximum}
\]  
\[
f''(2) = 6 > 0 \Rightarrow \text{local minimum}
\]

---

## 7. Note  
- Integration is used for areas and accumulation, not for finding extrema. Use differentiation for extrema.

And we can continue practicing differentiation problems tomorrow!
